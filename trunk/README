We have implemented A* algorithm in amar_astar.cpp
It has different modes of execution - Training (collects training samples for the classifier)
- Not training & no classifier (normal A* w/o any classifier)
- Not training & use classifier (use the values saved in classifier-*.txt)

Our implementation is kind of slow right now, and takes over 1 hour to run when target is at (2.75,0). We are working on fixing that, and seek conditional credit for now.
